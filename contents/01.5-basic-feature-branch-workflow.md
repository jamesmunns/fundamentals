# The Feature Branch Workflow
The Feature Branch Workflow is just one way of using git for a project. It is a great place to start for small to medium sized teams (2-10 developers), especially if they are new to using git. It works well both centrally (within one company), or distributed (open source teams, or developers in separate offices).

The workflow I am describing here is a "light" version of a common practice called "git flow". You can read more about that on the internet.

Here are some basic rules for the Feature Branch Workflow:

1. The `master` branch is always considered stable.
    * Code must compile and run without major errors
    * All currently written tests must pass on the master branch
    * All code must be peer reviewed before it is introduced into `master`
    * No one **ever** commits directly to `master`. All commits should be merges with no additional changes.
2. All work is done on `feature` branches.
    * It is normal to use a feature prefix to name a branch, for example: `feature/bring-up-main-adc`
    * Code that exists on `feature` branches is allowed to be unstable and untested
3. `feature` branches should be as short-lived as possible.
    * Get the code stable, tested, peer reviewed, and merged back to `master` as soon as possible so it does not become "stale", or out of date
    * `feature` branches should be kept up to date with changes to `master` as best as possible.
