# Overview

This book is broken into the following sections:

* Version Control
* Documentation
* Static Checkers
* Build System
* Unit Testing
* Ticketing System
* Peer Review
* Continuous Integration

Each section will contain (at least) the following information:

* **WHAT** is this thing?
* **WHY** each of these things are important
* **HOW MUCH** of each of these items are necessary for your project(s)
* **HOW** to do each of these items with open source and/or free tools
* Additional reference materials and non-free tools available

# Why am I writing this book?
Based on my experience, there are a number of items that are incredibly important to programmers, but are not strictly programming. Based on my personal research, excellent mentors, and having the chance to work in great teams, I was able to assemble this knowledge over my career (so far).

However, I have met many programmers who never learned all (or any) of these skills. These skills range from useful (for personal or open source projects), to mandatory to know and understand (for safety critical applications, like Avionics, Gas Detection, or Automtive industries).

In my experience, organizations and developers writing embedded systems code seem to trail more popular languages (such as Python or Ruby developers) in these concepts. Either way, the concepts of these skills will apply to nearly ANY language, and are valuable to developers new and old.

I personally suggest skimming the **WHY** sections, and then reading deeper whenever you have a project where this information is useful.
